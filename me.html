<h2>My Vision of A Goal</h2>
<ol>
<li>By taking the time to stop and appreciate who you are and what you've achieved - 
  and perhaps learned through a few mistakes, stumbles and losses -
  you actually can enhance everything about you. 
  Self-acknowledgment and appreciation are what give you the insights and awareness to move forward toward higher goals and accomplishments.</li>
