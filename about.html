<h2>My Vision of A Goal</h2>
<ol>
<li>By taking the time to stop and appreciate who you are and what you've achieved - 
  and perhaps learned through a few mistakes, stumbles and losses -
  you actually can enhance everything about you. 
  Self-acknowledgment and appreciation are what give you the insights and awareness to move forward toward higher goals and accomplishments.</li>

<h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>"If we experience any failures or setbacks, we do not forget them because they offend our self-esteem. 
      Instead, we reflect on them deeply, trying to figure out what went wrong and discern whether there are any patterns to our mistakes."</p>

<li>I am a great soccer player.</li>
